# SkillBoost.tech

This is the repository for generating the skillboost.tech website, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Doks Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/doks/). [Skill Boost](https://skillboost.tech) is intended help people "skill up" as technologists by getting to the root of what matters to them and helping them follow an upskilling path that they'll find meaningful and will be more likely to complete.

**[Why is this site different from all other sites?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Nishtana#Text)**: Anyone can build an unfiltered collection of educational resources, but that doesn't help people pick the right ones.

The whole point here is to help people determine what their learning goal is, what will help them satisfy that, where they are in their knowledge, and give them a guided path forward with free resources that are appropriate to their skill level and goal.
