# SkillBoost.tech

This is the repository for generating the skillboost.tech website, using Eleventy. Skillboost.tech is intended to combine a collection of links to and summaries of free educational resources to help people "skill up" as technologists.

**How is this site different from all other sites?**: This site attempts to help its visitors not only find educational resources, but to help them identify what they truly want to learn so they're more likely to stick with it and then provide curated guides to **free** resources that will help them learn them.
